            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>HIS MAJESTIES MESSAGE To the Honourable Houſes of Parliament aſſembled at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Honoured Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HEre hath been Sir <hi>Peter Killegrew,</hi> who is diſpatched to the Parliament with his Majeſty and the Commiſſioners their Anſwers to the houſes, concerning his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties remove from hence.</p>
            <p>The Votes of the houſes being commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the King, for his Majeſties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
<pb facs="tcp:160313:3"/>from hence to <hi>Richmond,</hi> with the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,</hi> His Majeſty gave not ſo poſitive an anſwer at the firſt, as afterwards.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty hath returned anſwer to the Parliament, by the Commiſſioners, to whom his Maieſty declared his mind herein, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to Col. <hi>Whalley,</hi> who commands the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of forces that are there.</p>
            <p>The ſubſtance of the one, and a Copy of the other, I have ſent you here incloſed.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> hath been with his Majeſty, and kiſſed the Kings hand. His Majeſty aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon his admittance, who he was, and being told, that it was Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the King gave him his hand to kiſſe, and ſaid, that he had often heard of him, but never ſaw him before: then his Maieſty had ſome diſcourſe with him, wherein Mr. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> declared what a pretious thing, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable it was, for a King to have the love of his ſubiects, and above all to be godly, &amp; how much heaven is more excellent then the things of this world.</p>
            <p>The King ſeemed to like his diſcourſe, &amp; commended it, and ſaid, that by what had
<pb facs="tcp:160313:3"/>bin told him of him, he did not expect ſuch rationall ſolid diſcourſe from him Mr. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> told his Maieſty, that if he pleaſed, he humbly deſired his Maieſty to give him leave to preach to him. The King anſwered no, he was not ſatisfied in that point yet, to hear any, but ſuch as hee hath already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, in a Church way,</p>
            <p>The King lyes at his own houſe here at Newmarket ſtill, it is a very faire ſpatious houſe and excellent good ayre, a fine garden and in every reſpect better accommadation then at Holmby, and his Maieſty is much better ſatisfied by being here, then he was at Holmby, and beſides that it gives his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty better content, becauſe it is neerer to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Maieſty goeth often out with the Commiſſioners to Bowles to Col. <hi>Ruſſels</hi> houſe (who was perſwaded lately of the day of Judgments neere approach, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon prepared for it, a very pretious godly man,) it is about five miles from hence, and about four miles on this ſide the Iſle of Ely, a very handſome fine houſe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:160313:4"/>
            <p> Here is no diſcontent here, but all things carryed on very fairly.</p>
            <p>The Kings Majeſty ſeemes to admire at the Atmies diſcreet carriage in this preſent buſineſſe, and divers others at this time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with it.</p>
